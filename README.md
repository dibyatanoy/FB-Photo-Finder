Download the photos you need in a few simple steps! Based on Python 3; uses EasyGui for selecting directories.

FB Photo Finder takes as input a list of user names and shows you a listing of all of your photos in which the user(s) is/are tagged. If you wish, you can proceed to download all of these to a directory of your choice.

Inspired by all the times I needed to find a good picture for a friendâ€™s birthday!

Download the .py file and run fb-photo-downloader.py. Remember to have an access token for the graph API ready (which you can get here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer)

Note:
* Finding the photos and downloading may take a while
* Script may not find all photos because some users may have disabled the graph API functionality
